## Overview
A multiplayer cavern diving game where players work together to reach deeper sections of procedurally generated caverns.
Find tools during your expedition, and work together to avoid traps, fall damage, and enemies.
Reach different cave biomes and get closer to the core of the planet to find the mythical ore, Mythril.

### Gameplay
The objective of Shroomfall is to descend as deep as possible into procedurally generated caverns while collecting resources, avoiding hazards, and working together to survive. Each run begins in a safe zone where players prepare their gear before entering the caves. As they progress, players encounter increasingly challenging traps, enemies, and environmental obstacles that require teamwork and strategic thinking. As you and your friends progress further down, you will encounter different biomes, all with their own unique mechanics and aesthetics. The ultimate goal is to survive long enough to reach the planet’s core and uncover the mythical ore, Mythril.

### Mechanics
Each run is procedurally generated, meaning no two expeditions are the same. Death isn’t the end; fallen teammates can be revived by reaching the end of cave biomes, where players can find a “rest area”  before tackling the next biome. Movement is physics-driven, with momentum-based jumping, climbing, and fall damage. Players can climb different surfaces, wall-jump, and use tools found to help navigate through the cavern. The environment is interactive, where players can pick up plants to be used as tools or triggerable events that can cause rocks to become unstable. Players communicate in close proximity to add a new level of immersion and cooperative mechanics.
